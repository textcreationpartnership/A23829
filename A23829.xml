            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO A FRIEND Concerning the Behaviour of Chriſtians under the various Revolutions of State-Governments.</head>
            <p>THE Revolutions that ſo frequently happen in States, may well engage an honeſt man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine how Chriſtians, and the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ought to behave themſelves in ſuch kind of Revolutions. I have therefore undertaken to anſwer your deſire, in as clear and perſpicuous a manner, as it is poſſible for me, without making too particular a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the preſent change of Government which hath put you upon propoſing this queſtion to me. You deſire to know of me whether it be lawful for a Chriſtian
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62967:4"/>to pray for a Prince whom he takes to be an Uſurper, and how the ancient Chriſtians behaved themſelves in the like Revolutions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Point is a queſtion of Right, whether it be unlawful to pray for a Prince, whom we believe to be an Uſurper; ſo, as that all thoſe who are of this Opinion, are obliged to ſeparate themſelves from the Communion of thoſe who believe him to be a lawful Prince: it being impoſſible that thoſe who think they ought to pray for a diſpoſſeſſed Prince, becauſe they conſider him as their lawful Prince, ſhould be preſent at the Prayers that are made for a Prince whom they conſider as an Uſurper. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Point is a matter of Fact, which I might excuſe my ſelf from entring upon; becauſe it is certain that Chriſtians are to order their Lives not by Examples but by Rules. However for your ſatisfaction I will not refuſe to take a a ſhort view of the Behaviour of the Primitive Chriſtians in ſuch kind of Revolutions.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt</hi> Point, I anſwer, That it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Chriſtian, but that he is alſo obliged in Conſcience to pray for thoſe, who are in poſſeſſion of the Authority of the State wherein he lives, if he hath a mind to obey the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to follow the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion. I ſuppoſe that that which is the Duty of every Chriſtian in particular, is the Duty alſo of the Church in general, foraſmuch as the Church is nothing but an Aſſembly of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Take we a view therefore of the command of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Firſt</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2; 3, 4. <q rend="inline">I exhort, therefore, that firſt of all, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving Thanks be made for all men, for Kings and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all men
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62967:4"/>to be ſav'd, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</q> The learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath thus para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed this Precept. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the firſt place therefore I adviſe thee and all the Biſhops under thy Metropolis, that you have conſtant publick Offices of Devotion, conſiſting. <hi>First,</hi> Of Supplications for the averting of all hurtful things, Sins and Danger. 2dly, Of Prayers for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of all good things which you want. 3dly, Of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for others, and 4thly, Of Thankſgiving for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies already received; and all theſe not only for your ſelves, but, in a greater diffuſion of your Charity, for all Mankind. 2dly, For the Emperors and Rulers of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under them, to whom we owe all our peaceable living in any place, in the exerciſe of Religion and virtuous Life, and therefore ought in reaſon to pray and give thanks for them. 3dly, For this God under the Goſpel approves of, and requires at our hands. 4thly, In proportion to the example which he hath given us in himſelf, who earneſtly deſires the good of all Mankind, and uſeth all powerful means to bring them to reform their former wicked Lives, and now to entertain the Goſpel. Whence it appears clearly that a Chriſtian, as ſuch, is obliged to offer up unto God publick Prayers for thoſe that are inveſted with the Sovereign Authority, and that this is a Duty of the Church in general.</p>
            <p>And here I deſire you to obſerve two things, the one is that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no diſtinction betwixt the lawful Emperors and Uſurpers: the other, that he grounds the neceſſity of theſe Prayers upon a principle of gratitude and acknowledgment to the Government in general, whoſoever they be that adminiſter it, foraſmuch as we are beholden to them for the peaceable life we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in the exerciſe of our Religion and a virtuous Life.</p>
            <p>This being thus ſtated, a Chriſtian can have no further ſcruple in this point, but only about the queſtion of matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> who thoſe be that are in actual poſſeſſion of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62967:5"/>the Sovereign Authority? But this is a queſtion which may no leſs eaſily be decided by the Rules of the Goſpel; in a word, every Chriſtian is obliged to acknowledge him for his lawful Prince, to whom he payeth tribute. This is the Doctrine of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> xii. and <hi>Luke</hi> xx. the words of the Goſpel are as follows; <q rend="inline">And the Chief Prieſts and the Scribes the ſame hour ſought to lay hands on him (but they feared the People) for they perceived that he had ſpoken this Parable againſt them. And they watched him, and ſent forth Spies, which ſhould feign themſelves Juſt Men, that they might catch him in his words, and ſo might deliver him unto the Power and Authority of the Governor. And they asked him ſaying, Maſter we know that thou ſayeſt and teacheſt rightly; neither accepteſt thou the Perſon of any, but teacheſt the way of God in Truth. Is it lawful for us to give Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or no? But he perceiving their craftineſs, ſaid unto them, why tempt ye me? ſhew me a penny: whoſe Image and Superſcription hath it? They anſwered and ſaid. <hi>Caeſars.</hi> And he ſaid unto them, Render therefore unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things which be <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and unto God the things that be God's. And they could not take hold of his words before the people; but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling at his anſwer held their peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of this anſwer of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, I ſhall again make uſe of an Annotation of the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the 22 <hi>Chap.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he explains what the <hi>Herodians</hi> were, and what gave occaſion to our Saviour to make this anſwer. Of the <hi>Jew</hi> ſome part, <hi>ſays he,</hi> acknowledged, and adhered to the <hi>Ceſarean</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Authority, ſome part lookt upon it, as an Uſurpation; and of this generally were the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</hi> This difference or controverſie was thus occaſioned. About one hundred and fifty years before the birth of Chriſt the Government of <hi>Judea</hi> came into the hands of the <hi>Zelots</hi> or <hi>Maccabees,</hi> among them <hi>Judas Maccabaeus</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62967:5"/>being in fear of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> entered into a League with the <hi>Romans,</hi> which continued about ninety years. Then <hi>Hircanus</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> the Sons of <hi>Alexander</hi> falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contention for the Kingdom, and the younger Brother <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> getting poſſeſſion of it, <hi>Hircanus</hi> applied himſelf to the <hi>Romans</hi> for redreſs, and by <hi>Antipater</hi>'s mediation beſought <hi>Pompey</hi> (being then near) to come with an Army to his relief; <hi>Pompey</hi> did ſo, and thereupon befieged <hi>Jeruſalem. Hircanus</hi>'s Party within, ſoon delivered it up; and <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi>'s party retired into that part, where the Temple ſtood, and <hi>Pompey</hi> ſtorm'd the Temple, and took it, and ſo the City came into the <hi>Romans</hi> power, and <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> was reſtored to the High Prieſthood, and Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> but ſo as to hold (as he obtained) it under the <hi>Romans</hi> protection: which they did (thoſe of them that were of <hi>Hircanus</hi>'s party) by conſent, and not by force, by a choice which the Factions among themſelves put them upon, and by way of dedition, and ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> plainly ſaith of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they had made a dedition of themſelves. Mean while they of <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi>'s party lookt upon the <hi>Romans</hi> as Uſurpers, and forcible Poſſeſſors; and thus it continued till our Saviour's time, and at this time ſome of each party, <hi>Phariſees</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Herodians,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> followers of <hi>Herod</hi>) on the other, came unto Chriſt, meaning to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare him in whatſoever he ſaid, and to take advantage either to inflame the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (which were the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent among the <hi>Jews</hi>) if he ſhould ſay that tribute was to be paid, or to bring him into danger of <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> party, if he ſhould ſay 'twas not to be paid; And though Chriſt's anſwer be punctually in favour of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperor, eſpecially to thoſe that took the Tribute to be his right, yet in prudence he thought fit to give ſuch an anſwer, as might beſt avoid the oppoſite danger.</p>
            <p>After theſe things here alledged you ſee that nothing can be more natural than to form this Argument: Every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62967:6"/>Chriſtian is obliged to acknowledge him for his lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, to whom he pays Tribute. This is the expreſs Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> therefore every Chriſtian is bound to pray for thoſe that are in Poſſeſſion of the Government, as for their true Sovereigns.</p>
            <p>There are but two ways to elude the force of its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; for either we muſt maintain that our Saviour argued like a Sophiſter, in going about to perſwade the Jews to own him for their lawful Prince, to whom they were forced to pay Tribute, in caſe it be true, that people may pay Tribute to a Prince, whom they ought not to acknowledge for their lawful Sovereign; or elſe we muſt maintain that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath engaged Chriſtians in ſin, by commanding them to pray univerſally for thoſe to whom they pay Tribute, though it may be ſuch men are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of power, and receive Tribute, for whom they ought not to pray. This conſequence is evident and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if it be true that the paying of tribute be neither a lawful mark of their Sovereignty, nor a lawful Foundation to pray for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you'll ſay the concluſion of your Argument will lead us to confound a lawful Government with that which is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, an Uſurper with a rightful Sovereign. At this rate of arguing tho' we are convinced in our Conſciences, that ſuch a one is an Uſurper, and ſuch a one our lawful Prince, we are forced according to your Argument to pray for the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and againſt our lawful Prince. That is to ſay, according to your ſenſe, we are charged by St:</hi> Paul <hi>to commit immoral acts, and are obliged to ſin againſt God, that we may be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to St.</hi> Paul. <hi>And this is enough,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to diſcover the Sophiſtry of your Argument.</hi> Why this is the very point, where I would fain have you. The Principle, I oppoſe, is, that it appertains to the Church to judge of the Title of thoſe who are in poſſeſſion of the Government, whether it be a rightful Title, or not; whereas I maintain on the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62967:6"/>contrary, that it doth not in the leaſt belong to the Church, to pronounce concerning the Title of thoſe who are in Poſſeſſion of the Sovereign Authority. It follows from this Principle, that we cannot lawfully pray to God for any but thoſe, whoſe Title to the Sovereignty we own to be rightful: And I maintain, that if this Concluſion, which is drawn from the Principle I oppoſe, be true, it is impoſſible for any Chriſtian Church to ſubſiſt in any State, and that conſequently the Concluſion, as well as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from whence it ſo naturally flows, cannot but be falſe.</p>
            <p>I deſire you, Sir, to take notice that I affirm that it doth not belong to a Chriſtian, as ſuch, to examine whether he who hath the power over a Society, poſſeſſeth the ſame by a Juſt Title or by Uſurpation. I acknowledge indeed that it is the right of the Society, and its Repreſentatives to examine this queſtion; but I flatly deny that it belongs to the Church, or to any of the people, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Chriſtians, to diſcuſs the Titles of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns. Chriſtians, in as much as they are Chriſtians, are in a State in the ſame manner as Phyſicians, who in that capacity have nothing to do to meddle with Affairs of State, tho' they may take cognizance of them as they are Citizens. Affairs therefore of State, muſt not be regulated by any but thoſe who are called to the management of them. And foraſmuch as the People are bound to ſubmit themſelves to the reſolution of their Repreſentatives, the Church accordingly is obliged to own him for a lawful Sovereign of the State whom the Managers of the State own for ſuch, by ordaining Tribute to be paid to him, and Prayers to be offer'd up to God for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is my Poſition, the Truth whereof I ſhall here ſet forth with a full and convincing evidence.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62967:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt declared that Tribute ought to be paid to thoſe, whom the greateſt part of the Jews lookt upon as Uſurpers (I mean the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors) and who indeed had uſurpt the Power, they themſelves had formerly enjoy'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Our Saviour did plainly ſuppoſe, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of their Emperors ought publickly to be prayed for in the Temple, as was conſtantly done, to which the Zealots of the <hi>Jews</hi> oppoſed themſelves; for otherwiſe he ought rather to have joined himſelf to theſe Zealots, and forbornt entring into the Temple, in caſe he had not approved the Prayers there offer'd up for ſuch Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught that we are bound to pray for thoſe that have the Authority in their hands, without ever making the leaſt diſtinction between thoſe that were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of this Authority by a lawful or unlawful Title. Now where the Law doth not diſtinguiſh, it is plain, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, It hath been the conſtant practice of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church to pray for thoſe that had the Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without ever allowing themſelves the Liberty to judge of the Validity or Invalidity of the Titles of thoſe, that were in poſſeſſion thereof. This practice of the Church in all times and in all places is ſo unconteſted a matter of Fact, that we may defie any Perſon whatever to produce any one ſingle example of a Schiſm that hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the Church, on a pretence like to that on which they have formed one of late, <hi>viz.</hi> where one party of the Church maintain'd that they ought not to pray for a Prince in Poſſeſſion, becauſe his Title was not lawful, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themſelves from thoſe that ſubmitted to him that was in Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>It is viſible that according to the contrary Principle, if the Church had not only a Right to examine the Title of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62967:7"/>Sovereigns, but were alſo under an obligation ſo to do for fear of offering diſpleaſing Prayers to his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, in favour of an Uſurper, that it was of indiſpenſable neceſſity for the Apoſtles to have made an exact draught of Politicks, fram'd according to the Nature and Rights of the Government; which they ought to have tranſmitted to their Succeſſors in writing. It would have been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alſo in the Church, to inſtruct the Biſhops, and all the Clergy, conformably to this Scheme of Politicks, to the end that they might afterward inſtruct the Church, and yet we do not find a tittle of all this neither in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any other Books of Antiquity: Tho' without this ſo neceſſary precaution it cannot be imagin'd, but that a vaſt number of Schiſmes muſt have been formed, by occaſion of ſo many Revolutions that have ſo ſtrangely changed the Face of Governments, from the time of our Saviour to this preſent. We muſt therefore of neceſſity own either that none of the ancient Chriſtians, ever thought of diſcharging a duty ſo eſſential to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the moſt important Acts of Devotion, or that the Chriſtians never believed, that it was their buſineſs to examine the Rights of Sovereigns, much leſs that they were obliged ſo to do, to the end they might be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to offer their prayers to God with a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>I have told you, Sir, That the Chriſtian Religion could never have been admitted, or have ſubſiſted in any State, if our Saviour had given another Rule to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles than that which he hath given them. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I entreat you to conſider with your ſelf a little, what would have become of the Chriſtian Religion, if the Church had undertaken to examin the Titles of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns? Can you believe in good earneſt, that ever ſhe would have met with an eaſie entrance into the World; if it had been known, that thoſe who preached
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62967:8"/>it, entred into a State with a deſign and under obligations of examining the Titles of thoſe who govern'd it, and with a deſign of charging upon the Subjects as their duty an enquiry of this Nature. I am certain that we cannot meet with any thing like this, neither in the Writings of the Apoſtles, nor in the Writings of the ancient Doctors of the Church, particularly in their Apologies, wherein they have refuted the principal grounds for which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors rejected the Chriſtian Religion and proſcribed it. Yea, I am very ready to be ſo juſt to thoſe who are of the contrary Opinion as to believe that they would have more Prudence, than to make any ſuch kind of Declaration to the Indians or Chineſe, if they had a mind to go and Preach the Goſpel amongſt them.</p>
            <p>But ſome, it may be, may be apt to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion is the rather to be received upon this Condition of engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects to examin the Title of their Soveraigns and the whole State. For indeed it may be thought what can be more advantageous to a Society or a Prince, than Souls of ſo tender a conſcience as are unwilling to pray for a Prince till they have diſcuſs'd the point whether their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles be lawful? But yet I know not whether they would have been able to make the Goſpel to be Received on thoſe terms. For 1. It plainly appears that they muſt have left all thoſe Countries which from Monarchies were newly changed to Common-wealths, or the contrary. 2d. It appears that they would have been excluded out of any Country where a Prince had been depos'd, and another put in his place; foraſmuch as they could not obey the Laws of an uſurper, nor own him by praying for him. 3dly. They muſt, even in thoſe places where the government appear'd to them lawful, at their firſt entrance have declar'd, that their true diſciples would be always ready to withdraw themſelves from under the authority of the government aſſoon as any change ſhould be made in it contrary to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62967:8"/>their Scheme of a lawful Government, and that they would do their utmoſt endeavours, to withdraw from the State all thoſe that could not comply with this Change in the Government. This ſuppoſed, let them judge in how many places they could have got an entrance for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, clogg'd with thoſe Conditionals.</p>
            <p>But there is ſomething Worſe than all this; for by this jumbling of political Conſiderations about Government with the doctrine of the Goſpel, the Apoſtles would have been Obliged at their firſt entrance to preſent the Governor of the Place a draught of a lawful Government according to their Notion, to the end that the State might Conſider whether this political Scheme, did agree with the Nature of Government as it is eſtabliſht amongſt the ſeveral Nations of the World. This is the point whence they ought of neceſſity to have begun the preaching of the Goſpel, for without this Chriſtians could never be perſwaded to offer up their prayers to God for the Governour of a State. In very truth, the Apoſtles would have ſeemed a company of pityful Men, for underſtanding their Commiſſion no better, as having failed to leave us a good and ample inſtruction in this moſt important matter, and which was of ſo great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, conſidering the vaſt number of Changes and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that have happened in Governments: whereas inſtead of uſing this exactneſs they have only ſimply and in general commanded us to pray to God for all the Powers ſet over us, but they never daigned to acquaint us either by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or doctrine that this was to be reſtrained onely to ſuch Powers as are lawful. But they will ſay ſince you grant that a Chriſtian and a Citizen are one and the ſame Perſon, under different reſpects, how is it poſſible that after all this you ſhould conceive, that a Citizen, who is perſwaded in his Conſcience that ſuch an one is an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, may yet as a Chriſtian, pray God for this Uſurper, as if indeed he were his lawful Prince? To this I anſwer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62967:9"/>that a Man who embraceth any Principles contrary to the Conſtitution of a State, is very much to be pitied, and if beſides he be ſo unhappy as to fill his brain with whimſeys without any ground or probability of truth, and takes pains to confirm himſelf in the ſame from paſſages of Scripture miſapplied, he is ſtill more incurable; becauſe in this caſe he huggs his error, as ſuppoſing it both Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Meritorious. But to anſwer directly to this difficulty: I ſay that the Conſcience of ſuch a Perſon is moſt Viſibly Erroneous. For 1. he judgeth in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Citizen that ſuch an one is an Uſurper for whom it is not lawful to pray; becauſe, as he is a Chriſtian, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a Doctrin and Principle in Conſequence whereof he oppoſeth himſelf againſt the determination of the State, which hath manifeſtly acted and judged according to other Principles. If he forms this judgment as he is a Chriſtian, then he attributes to himſelf a right which God hath never granted to Chriſtians as ſuch, but if he judge thus in the quality of a Citizen and not of a Chriſtian, he violates the laws of a Society which can not ſubſiſt if every private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be permitted to oppoſe his particular judgment to that of the publick, declared in the moſt ſolemn manner imaginable; the deluſion of the Conſcience of ſuch a Perſon appears as evident to me as if a Perſon ſhould have reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to maintain from Scripture as a Doctrine of faith, that the Sun goes round the Earth, and in conſequence to this Principle ſhould refuſe Communion with thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Syſteme of <hi>Copernicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I don't beleive that thoſe who repreſent the body of the State are infallible in their judgment, but ſeeing it is the higheſt Human Tribunal where theſe queſtions which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the right of thoſe that pretend to the Government can be decided; I aſſert that if a Citizen hath a judgment oppoſite to that of the State, either he muſt acquieſce in the judgment of the State, or he muſt depart out of it,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62967:9"/>for fear of being made partaker of the puniſhment which he beleives God may inflict upon a State for an unjuſt action, but after all there is none but God that can Correct that which he hath reſerved to his Government. This is that which Conſcience muſt naturally dictate to a Man who liſtens to its Suggeſtions.</p>
            <p>This being granted, I ſay in the 2d. place, that they who reaſon thus and continue in the State, whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they do not acknowledge, do not follow their own principles as they are bound to do: Suppoſe we therefore that they ought to ſeparate themſelves from their brethren; foraſmuch as in the quality of Chriſtians they cannot joyn in thoſe Prayers that offend their Morals, are they not as much obliged, in the quality of Citizens to quit a Society, which they ſuppoſe to have violated the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws of the State by raiſing an Uſurper to the Throne of the Lawful Prince? The obligation if I be not miſtaken is as binding on this hand, as on the other.</p>
            <p>This is an ignorant flattering of our ſelves, to believe that we may lawfully preſerve a propriety in our Eſtates by continuing in a State, which we look upon as being in actual Rebellion againſt their Soveraign; for it is certain that the poſſeſſion of the goods we enjoy, as members of the Society, is no further allowed us than as we own the Authority whereby the Society doth ſubſiſt. We have no right to them any further than as the Society allows us to enjoy the ſame, and that we own the Authority of the Rulers of the Society. The propriety we have in our goods is not from a Natural Right, but from a Poſitive Right, which cannot ſubſiſt but in the Society. As ſoon as we quit a Society, which we do when we diſown its Authority, we have no longer any right to our goods, and accordingly <hi>ipſo facto</hi> they ceaſe to be ours. And therefore a ſtranger who is bound by his oath to his own
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62967:10"/>Prince, can poſſeſs nothing in a forreign State; he hath no leave to trade in a ſtrange Country any further than he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelf to the laws of the Society, and to undergo the puniſhments which the Law inflicts in caſe it appear that he hath violated the Laws of it. This is the Doctrin of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> upon St. <hi>John</hi> confirmed by <hi>Yves</hi> of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, Epiſt.</hi> 65. By what right, ſaith he to the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, do you keep poſſeſſion of the Lands belonging to the Churches, is it by Divine or Human Right? The Divine Right is contained in the Scriptures, and the Human in the Laws of Kings, whereupon you perceive that whatſoever a Man poſſeſſeth, he poſſeſſeth it by an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Right; but as to a Divine Right, the Earth is the Lords and the Fulneſs thereof. 'Tis by Human Right that any one faith this Land is mine, this Houſe is mine, this Slave is mine. Take away the Right of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and who dares ſay this Land is mine, this Houſe is mine, this Slave is mine. Neither do thou ſay, what have you to do with the King; yea what haſt thou to do with this Poſſeſſion? Don't ſay that thy Poſſeſſions are thine for thou haſt renounced Human Right by which onely one poſſeſſeth whatſoever he has, for if theſe things were eſtabliſhed by a Divine Law, it would not be in the Power of the Judges in ſome caſes to judge according to the Rigor of the Laws, and in other caſes more favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. Nay Sir to reſide onely under any Government, makes a Man ſubject to the ſaid Government <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> for otherwiſe a Stranger could not be juſtly puniſht for being guilty of high Treaſon againſt a Prince whoſe Subject he is not.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid thus much to remove a deluſion ſome put upon themſelves in this matter, for want of due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, imagining that they may lawfully enjoy their Eſtates without owning the Authority of thoſe that Govern the State, and that they ſatisfie their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by refuſing to pray for them, when indeed they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62967:10"/>do own their Authority, by having recourſe to thoſe Laws and Magiſtrates, who ſecure the Enjoyment of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; the Magiſtrates who Execute the Laws, having no other Authority, but what is derived from thoſe that Actually Govern the State.</p>
            <p>Is it not ſtrange, Sir, to ſee Men for the preſerving the poſſeſſion of their Goods to perſwade themſelves, that by their not praying for him whom they look upon to be an Uſurper, they have done enough to ſatisfie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? It is every whit as much a Duty to pay tribute to the Higher Powers, and a Duty to which Conſcience Obligeth us (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it in the 13th. of the <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to the <hi>Romans, Ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6.) as it is to pray for them; for neither can the Peace of a Nation be kept without Arms, nor Arms maintain'd without Salaries, nor Salaries of Souldiers without Tribute. Thus <hi>Tacitus</hi> Explains the Juſtice of Tributes.</p>
            <p>If therefore you do not believe the Authority to be Lawful, why can you pay Tribute which is exacted to maintain this unlawful Authority? Is not this to imitate the Conſcience of the Jews, whom Our Saviour reproves for having denied the Power and Authority of <hi>Ceſar</hi> at the ſame time when they acknowledged that they paid Tribute to Him? You will ſay we are Active in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an unlawful Authority, but we are onely paſſive in paying Tribute, becauſe that Authority forces us thereto by ways we cannot oppoſe, as wanting power ſo to do. See here a ſubtle peice of Divinity: according to theſe Principles when St. <hi>Paul</hi> orders us to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to thoſe to whom Tribute is due, he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Subjects to be Active in paying Tribute but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Paſſive by ſuffering it to be taken from them by force. What is the meaning of a Tribute ſave onely a contribution that is raiſed to maintain the Authority
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62967:11"/>that governs us? Is it not therefore as poſitive an act of the Subject as the Honour he renders to whom Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due? But beſides, if this anſwer be ſatisfactory it hath this little inconvenience, that it furniſheth the <hi>Jews</hi> with an anſwer to our Saviour's Argument: The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were reduced to ſilence becauſe they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be a ſufficient juſtification of themſelves to ſay to our Saviour, <hi>Caeſar</hi> forceth the Tribute from us, we are only paſſive in paying it. Had they been acquainted with this diſtinction, they would have ſtopt our Saviour's mouth; without doubt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make reſiſtance which obliged them to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but the action of paying Tribute to him whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they diſowned, was ſufficient to condemn them, which accordingly alſo put them to ſilence. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is ſtill the ſame Judge he was formerly with reſpect to the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Maxime of Jeſus Chriſt is that we muſt own him for our lawful Sovereign to whom we pay tribute, and who is poſſeſt of the Publick Authority, as appears by the Stamp of Current Money.</p>
            <p>I know that ſome may take an occaſion to raiſe a Diſpute here, becauſe the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> when explains thoſe words of the xiii. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans; Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers,</hi> he underſtands it of Sovereigns that are rightly eſtabliſhed and conſtituted, and of Supream Governours legally placed in that Kingdom. Whence it follows, that we are not bound to pay tribute to thoſe who have none of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, Conſcience only obliging us to day Tribute to ſuch, who being lawfully conſtituted, may and ought to be conſider'd as God's Miniſters. But I deſire you to conſider. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That according to Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> confeſſion, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſign was to oppoſe the Doctrine of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who believed that a Heathen could have no lawful Authority over Chriſtians, and made the Liberty of the Goſpel to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62967:11"/>conſiſt in this Maxime; according as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf on the 8 <hi>verſe</hi> of St. <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtle. 2dly, That the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not give any Right, nor impoſe any neceſſity upon every Chriſtian to oppoſe his Judgment to the Sentiment and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the State, about the Right of the Sovereign that is placed on the Throne; but that he hath wholly left it to the Eſtates to determine who are their true and lawful Sovereigns. And that he hath impoſed a neceſſity upon Believers to pay tribute to all thoſe that are owned to be ſuch, as a thing that is their due, foraſmuch as they are the Miniſters of God. For if we conceive the thing otherwiſe; St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Chriſtians to examine the Title of ſuch as are inveſted with the Government, for to judge whether it were lawful or no, and this even after that the State had owned them as lawful. The <hi>Roman</hi> Senate having Originally had the Right of naming the Emperors, as we ſee by the ſeveral Elections they have made, as well as by thoſe which it hath approved, when the Armies had prevented its choice; and by this means the Chriſtians would have been diſpenſed with from paying tribute to all thoſe who had invaded the Empire, or who had not obtained the Approbation of the Senate, for their Election made by the Army; or elſe would be obliged to perform, without any regard to conſcience, an act whereof the Apoſtle would have Conſcience to be the Principle, as being founded upon an Emanation of the Authority of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>I comprize here in a few words the force of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reaſoning. St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands Chriſtians to pray for the Soveraign Powers of the State where they live; he orders them to pay the Tributes that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to maintain their Domination, and to exerciſe their Authority. He grounds both theſe duties upon the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62967:12"/>obligation that lies upon us to wiſh all poſſible good to thoſe, who are the Conſervators of the Society in which we live, and to contribute to the Safety and Security the Church enjoys under their Protection, ſo that he ſuppoſeth that theſe two duties with regard to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Powers are inſeparable. If you cannot in good Conſcience pray for the Sovereign Powers, which the Body of the State owns for ſuch, then neither can you in good Conſcience pay them any tribute; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if you can in good conſcience pay them tribute, which is deſign'd to maintain their Domination, you may with as good a Conſcience pray for their proſperity.</p>
            <p>But this, I ſuppoſe, is enough, Sir, as to the firſt Article of the Queſtion you have propoſed to me; I have by the by touch'd upon the ſecond; which I am now willing to examin more carefully, becauſe I perceive that Examples often have as great an influence upon the Spirits of men, as the ſtrongeſt and moſt deciſive Arguments.</p>
            <p>To be aſſured how the Primitive Chriſtians behav'd themſelves, who could not but be acquainted with the Practice of the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, we need only to take notice of the Terms of their Liturgies: which the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath quoted in his Annotations on the Second Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> 'Of theſe four ſorts of prayer 'tis affirm'd by St <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that they were in his time all uſed in the Church, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>Accordingly I deſire you to take notice. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this was a ſet Form, in which nothing might be changed except only the name of him that was raiſed to the Throne. 2dly, That it doth not appear by any Record of the Church, that the reading of theſe Prayers was ever ſuſpended in any caſe whatſoever. 3dly, That there never aroſe any controverſie in the Church, about what Emperor they were to pray for, the Church always acknowledging him to be Emperor, who had that title in thoſe places where it was ſettled: 4thly, That there never happened any Schiſm on this account, during all the manifold Revolutions of the Empire. 5thly, That there never was a Canon of Council made to regulate the Penance that was to be impoſed upon thoſe that had prayed for an Uſurper, againſt a lawful Prince. 6thly, That it doth not appear that ever any Heathen Emperor perſecuted the Chriſtians of one Country, for having prayed for him who had uſurped the Empire in the places where they lived. 7thly, We do not find that ever any Chriſtian in his Commentaries upon the Scripture hath taken notice that it was the Belief of the Church that they ought to make a diſtinction between an Uſurper of the Empire, and a lawful Emperor, before they made Prayers for him.</p>
            <p>Would you have ſome examples to evidence to you the Truth of theſe Obſervations? <hi>Caſſius</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> revolted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> the Philoſopher, at the Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Fauſtina</hi> the Emperor's own Wife: and upon the News that was ſpread abroad, that <hi>Marck Antonine</hi> was dead, he uſurped the Abſolute Power that had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him by the Army which was in <hi>Pannonia:</hi> But this news of the Emperor's death being found to be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62967:13"/>he notwithſtanding carried on his pretenſions, and made himſelf to be owned Emperor by the Provinces of <hi>Cilicia, Syria, Judea,</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> Do you believe, Sir, that the Chriſtians of thoſe Provinces did continue to pray publickly for <hi>Mark Antonine,</hi> and that they refuſed to pray for <hi>Caſſius</hi> in their Publick Service; if they had done ſo, they muſt have expoſed themſelves to the Perſecution of <hi>Caſſius;</hi> or if they did pray publickly for <hi>Caſſius,</hi> they muſt thereby have ſeparated themſelves from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of thoſe Chriſtians who lived under the Empire of <hi>Mark Antonine.</hi> But where do we read that <hi>Caſſw</hi> perſecuted them for not owning his Authority; or that ever they were excommunicated by the other Chriſtians for having prayed for <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who was an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>Do not imagin, <hi>Sir,</hi> that <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth oppoſe what I here aſſert, when he ſaith in his Apology, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Chriſtians were found to be Caſſians, Albini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Nigrians, as if the Chriſtians who lived in thoſe Countries where <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Albinus</hi> and <hi>Niger</hi> had revolted, the firſt againſt <hi>Mark Antonine,</hi> and the other two againſt the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> had refuſed to pray for theſe Uſurpers, and had always in their publick Service prayed for <hi>Mark Antonine,</hi> and for <hi>Severus;</hi> but his deſign onely was to aſſert, that never any Chriſtians had a hand in theſe Conſpiracies, which were always carried on by Heathens onely. And for the reſt he ſufficiently intimates, that they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd themſelves with examining the Title of thoſe who were in Poſſeſſion of the publick Authority, when he ſaith, ſpeaking in the Name of the Chriſtians; <hi>Nobis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulla res magis aliena, quam Publicae, Unam omnium agnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus Rempublicam Mundum;</hi> that is, no matters are greater Strangers to us, than thoſe of the Publick; we are not much concern'd for any other Common Wealth beſides the one great Common Wealth of the World.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62967:14"/>
            <p>Do you beleive, Sir, that the Chriſtians of the Eaſt prayed for <hi>Aurelian,</hi> whilſt they were under the Power of <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> Wife of the Emperor <hi>Odenat,</hi> whom <hi>Galienus</hi> the Emperor had Aſſociated in the Empire, and whoſe Rights ſhe maintained in favour of her Children, againſt <hi>Aurelian;</hi> or that after the Defeat of <hi>Zenobia</hi> by <hi>Aurelian</hi> they refuſed to pray for him, under pretence that <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> and her Children, for whom they had prayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had their lives given them by the Emperor? Did not the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> acknowledge the Authority of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as ſoon as he had Vanquiſht <hi>Zenobia,</hi> by petitioning that Emperor to drive away <hi>Paulus Samoſatenſis</hi> from his Epiſcopal Manſion, which they could not obtain of <hi>Zenobia,</hi> who had ſupported him in oppoſition to their former Judgment?</p>
            <p>Can you imagin that ever the Chriſtians concern'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to interpoſe their Judgment in oppoſition either to the Senate, or the Army, when the Army having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated an Emperor in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the Senate nominated another in the <hi>Weſt?</hi> as it happened after the Death of <hi>Aurelian;</hi> and that they pronounced which of theſe two was the Lawful Emperor, to the end that they might lawfully and of right pray for him, in refuſing to pray for the Uſurper? Or do you believe that the Chriſtians of <hi>Africa</hi> did not pray for <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had caus'd himſelf to be proclaim'd Emperor there, or that thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the dependencies of it, did refuſe to pray for <hi>Maxentius</hi> during the five years wherein he poſſeſſed the Soveraign Authority there?</p>
            <p>For my part I muſt own, that I cannot conceive, but that, if the Chriſtians had refuſed to pray for thoſe whom they conſider'd as Uſurpers, this their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal would have raiſed a Perſecution againſt them, from thoſe who had uſurped the Empire; or why thoſe who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62967:14"/>have tranſmitted the Memory of the Martyrs of the Church, have not made mention of any that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd becauſe they refuſed to pray for an Uſurper, being by this means Martyrs, both of Jeſus Chriſt and of the Title of their lawful Emperors. Neither can I any whit better conceive how or by what means the Chriſtians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exactly agreed about the Title of their Emperors, when the People, the Souldiers, and the Senate have been frequently divided in their Sentiments about it. And if ever the Chriſtians were divided in their opinions about this matter, in the ſeveral Provinces of their Settlement, how is it that never any Schiſm happened amongſt them; and if ever there were any, how is it that the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtoriographers, who have given us an account of the ſeveral Schiſms, have never mention'd any that was occaſion'd upon this account?</p>
            <p>If you ſuppoſe that the Chriſtians were in ſo obſcure a condition before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did not mind their Prayers, provided they did but pay their Tribute, and that accordingly they might pray for the lawful Emperors, under the Noſes of the Uſurpers: at leaſt you cannot imagine any ſuch thing to have been ſince 333. when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had brought the Pagan Religion to truckle under the Chriſtian, and had given the Chriſtians all the advantage of a Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. After that the Emperor <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was killed, <hi>Magnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> made himſelf the Maſter of the <hi>Gaules</hi> in <hi>Illyria; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranio</hi> takes to himſelf the Imperial Purple; <hi>Nepotianus</hi> cauſeth himſelf to be proclaim'd <hi>Auguſtus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and twenty eight days after his Coronation was defeated by the Army of <hi>Magnentius,</hi> by which means <hi>Magnentius,</hi> continued Maſter of <hi>Africa, Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Gaules:</hi> Do we read any where that the Biſhops of the <hi>Gaules, Italy</hi> or <hi>Africa</hi> ever refuſed during the three years of the Reign of <hi>Magnentius</hi> to pray for him? When <hi>Julian,</hi> took upon him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62967:15"/>the Purple in the <hi>Gaules</hi> in 360. in ſpite of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> did the Biſhops of the <hi>Gaules</hi> thereupon refuſe to pray for him till after the death of <hi>Conſtantius?</hi> When <hi>Procopius</hi> made himſelf to be declar'd Emperor at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in 365. do you read that the Chriſtians of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did ever think of refuſing to pray for him, or that any were excommunicated for praying for him, during the year of his Reign? When <hi>Eugenius</hi> invaded the <hi>Gaules</hi> after his having killed <hi>Valentinian</hi> the younger, did not the Biſhops of the <hi>Gaules</hi> make publick Prayers for <hi>Eugenius</hi> for the ſpace of two years and more? When <hi>Gildo</hi> in the year 396, poſſeſt himſelf of <hi>Africa,</hi> did not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> for a whole year together make any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers for him, becauſe forſooth, he was an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? When <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſeized the <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> in 407. and continued in poſſeſſion of them till 411, did the Biſhops of Great <hi>Britain</hi> and the <hi>Gaules</hi> pray all this time for <hi>Honorius,</hi> without praying for <hi>Conſtantius?</hi> When <hi>Alaric</hi> after he had taken <hi>Rome,</hi> made <hi>Attalus</hi> to be choſen Emperor in 409. did any refuſe to pray for him in the Countries under his ſubjection? When one called <hi>John,</hi> cauſed himſelf to be proclaim'd Emperor at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the <hi>West</hi> againſt the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> III. can any one ſhew us that the Chriſtians refuſed to pray for him, during the year that he was in poſſeſſion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and divers other Provinces of the <hi>Weſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should I go about to run over all the Hiſtory of te Church and Empire, I could every where make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this was ever the behaviour of the Chriſtians in theſe caſes, but becauſe I am to confine my ſelf within the Bounds of a Letter, I ſhall tie my ſelf to four Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which will be ſufficient to make you judge of the reſt. The Firſt is taken out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who oppos'd <hi>Licinius</hi> his Brother in Law and Collegue in the Empire, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62967:15"/>but to put a ſtop to the Violent Perſecution which <hi>Licinius</hi> had raiſed in the Empire of the <hi>East,</hi> which was his Part. How did the Chriſtians behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after that <hi>Licinius</hi> was overcome and forced by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to betake himſelf to a Private Life, did they refuſe to pray for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> under Pretence that <hi>Licinius</hi> the Father was yet alive? Or did they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to pray for <hi>Licinius</hi> the Father, or <hi>Licinius</hi> the Son, whom his Father had declar'd <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> I know no body that was capable of ſuch a prepoſterous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour ſave onely <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> who had all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long been a great Favourer of <hi>Licinius</hi> againſt <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> All the reſt of the Chriſtians were overjoyed at this Revolution, and the Nicene Council bleſſed God for it, and ordered publick Thankſgivings therefore.</p>
            <p>See here another Example, which I would deſire you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider. The Emperor <hi>Gratianus</hi> having been aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated by Count <hi>Andragalbius, Maximus</hi> thereupon inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Britain,</hi> the Gauls and <hi>Spain,</hi> and was there proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emperor. Do you ſuppoſe that the Churches of theſe Three Great Provinces of the Empire of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> did continue to pray for <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whom <hi>Gratian</hi> had aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the Empire, and that they refus'd to pray for <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus?</hi> Or do you imagin that any Schiſm happen'd amongſt the Chriſtians of theſe Three Provinces upon this occaſion? True it is that there happened a Schiſme between the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> the greater part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of refuſed to communicate with thoſe Biſhops, that had employed the Authority of <hi>Maximus</hi> for the puniſhing of <hi>Priſcillian,</hi> ſo great an Enmity did this Church at that time bear againſt all Perſecution; but we do not read that the other Biſhops divided themſelves, ſome of them thinking themſelves bound to pray for <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and other for <hi>Maximus</hi> the Uſurper. Let any Man read
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62967:16"/>over the Monuments of thoſe times, and he ſhall no where find any the leaſt inſtance that the Chriſtians of Great <hi>Britain</hi> did follow any other order in their Prayers, than the Gauls and Spaniards did.</p>
            <p>If ever there were a juſt occaſion to refuſe to pray for an Emperour, it was then when <hi>Phocas</hi> invaded the Empire and uſurped it from <hi>Maurice.</hi> The Barbarous Cruelty which he uſed towards that Emperour and four of his Children, cannot be read without Sorrow; <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Son of <hi>Maurice,</hi> whom his Father had declared <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> had eſcaped the Maſſacre.</p>
            <p>Well, do we find that for all this the Church refuſed to pray for <hi>Phocas?</hi> They who will read the 38th. <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of the XI. Book of the Pope that then was, may judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the name whereof <hi>Gregory</hi> writes to <hi>Phocas,</hi> after that his Acceſſion to the Empire had been ſignifi'd to the Church, and to the <hi>Roman Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> made any difficulty to pray for <hi>Phocas,</hi> whom all Succeeding Poſterity have conſider'd as a great Tyrant.</p>
            <p>I could eaſily make it appear that the ſame Maximes have been followed by all the Kingdoms of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which were raiſed from the Ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; but it will be ſufficient to alledge onely the Example of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some years ſince a great Queſtion hath been ſtarted between Father <hi>le Cointe,</hi> and the Doctors of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The latter contending that the <hi>Franks</hi> did not deprive King <hi>Childeric</hi> of the Royal Title, but by the concurring Authority of Pope <hi>Zachary;</hi> whereas Father <hi>le Cointe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects this opinion for a meer Legend, mantaining that the Depoſition of <hi>Childeric</hi> was perform'd by the Sole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62967:16"/>of the State of the <hi>Franks.</hi> See here what <hi>Pape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocius</hi> writes to prove that it is not improbable, that Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> never ſo much as conſented to this Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the whole Body of the Nation judged it juſt and neceſſary. <q rend="inline">For it was no new thing, ſaith he, for the <hi>Franks,</hi> when they had diſpatcht any of their Kings or thruſt them into Monaſteries, to ſubſtitute o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their Room, ſuch as were indeed of the <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingian</hi> Line, yet not always thoſe that were the next Heirs in a right Line of Succeſſion; as is evident to any one, that reads the Hiſtory of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> ſtuft with Royal Tragedies and Revolutions, wherewith the Popes never concern'd themſelves, or enquir'd into the Right and Title of thoſe in Poſſeſſion of the Throne, by what means ſoever they got to it. And when ever did the Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> refuſe to crown, or the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhops to own thoſe Emperours, which Fortune any way ſoever offer'd to them? For ſeeing none of the Biſhops, nor of the Abbots, nor any of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who at that time were accounted famous for their Learning and Sanctity, did oppoſe the Elevation of King <hi>Pippin,</hi> if Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> had undertaken to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, his oppoſition would have been to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt ſuch an unanimus Reſolution of the whole Kingdom, already executed; and to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting ſave onely the Ceremony of the Sacred Unction or Coronation.</q> The reaſon of my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging <hi>Papebrocius</hi> that famous Compiler of the Laws of the Saints, is onely to let you ſee, how true the matter I have here advanced is, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church never at any time refuſed to pray for thoſe, who have been owned by the Body of the State, and that the Chriſtians in all Ages have been infinitely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrang'd from that Maxim; whereon ſome Men do now build the Schiſme we deplore, <hi>viz.</hi> That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62967:17"/>to the Church to Judge who is the Lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and that ſhe can and may conſider him as an Uſurper, who is owned by the State, and that its Members ought to refuſe to pray for him, and to ſeparate themſelves from thoſe, who do; as from Perſons that openly Violate the Laws of God, and the Obligations of Conſcience; which I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh theſe Gentlemen may take into their Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration.</p>
